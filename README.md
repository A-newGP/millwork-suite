OpenCabinet is a free, open source and modular suite for designing,
documenting and manufacturing architectural millwork and cabinetry.

## Why another tool?

The difference is millwork knowledge, not yet another generic CAD program.
The project starts where a shop gets value first: a cabinet designer that
produces a correct cut list and bill of materials. A general 2D CAD module
comes much later, once a community exists to sustain it.

## Principles

1. **Free forever.** Distributed derivatives stay open (copyleft).
2. **Useful early.** Every phase delivers something a shop can use on real
   jobs.
3. **Your data is yours.** Open, documented file formats; no lock-in.
4. **Works offline and without AI.** Core features never depend on an
   external or paid service.
5. **Truly modular.** Install only what you use; the core runs on modest
   hardware.
6. **Secure by design.** Plugins get no file, network or data access without
   declared permissions.
7. **Honest about its size.** Process and structure grow with the community,
   not before.

## Status

**OpenCabinet Designer 0.1.0-beta.1** is the first test release: cabinets,
cut lists, machining, walls and elevations, exported as CSV, PDF and DXF.
It is for shops willing to try it on a real job and
[report what is wrong](https://github.com/OpenCabinet/opencabinet/issues/new/choose);
download it from the [releases](https://github.com/OpenCabinet/opencabinet/releases),
and see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for what it does and does not do yet.

See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for what comes next. Decisions that are hard
to reverse are recorded as [architecture decision records](docs/adr/).

Imperial units (including fractional inches) are the default; metric is a
first-class option.
