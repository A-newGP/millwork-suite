//! Elevations (RFC-0001 §5): each wall seen from the room, with its openings
//! and the products placed on it, and the checks of where products are
//! placed.
//!
//! An elevation runs `x` along the wall from its start, as the placements'
//! offsets do, and `y` up from the floor. A product on a wall takes the
//! wall from its offset to its offset plus its width, its back on the
//! wall's front face, which is to the left walking from the wall's start
//! to its end.
//!
//! The checks give warnings, not errors: a product placed wrong still has
//! the right parts.
