//! The evaluator: turns products into parts by the rules of their
//! construction standard (RFC-0001 §9).
//!
//! Evaluation is a pure function of the authored data: the same project
//! always gives the same parts, to the nanometer, on every computer.
//!
//! # What this version evaluates
//!
//! Frameless and face frame base, wall and tall cabinets (`base-cabinet@1`,
//! `wall-cabinet@1`, `tall-cabinet@1`) with slab or five-piece doors,
//! drawer fronts and false fronts, drawer boxes and adjustable shelves:
//! full overlay when frameless, partial overlay or inset with a face frame.
//! Notation:
//! `W`, `H`, `D` the product's width, height and depth; `T` the actual
//! thickness of the `case` material; `K` the toe kick height, none for a
//! wall cabinet; `S` the stretcher width; `G` the front gap; `g` the back
//! groove depth. The box height is `Hb = H − K`.
//!
//! | Part | Length × width | Banded edges |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `case/side.left`, `case/side.right` | `Hb` × `D` | front (`y1`) |
//! | `case/bottom` | `W − 2T` × `D` | front (`y1`) |
//! | `case/stretcher.front`, base only | `W − 2T` × `S` | front (`y1`) |
//! | `case/stretcher.back`, base only | `W − 2T` × `S` | none |
//! | `case/top`, wall and tall | `W − 2T` × `D` | front (`y1`) |
//! | `case/back`, grooved, base | `Hb − T + g` × `W − 2T + 2g` | none |
//! | `case/back`, grooved, wall and tall | `Hb − 2T + 2g` × `W − 2T + 2g` | none |
//! | `case/back`, applied | `Hb` × `W` | none |
//!
//! Fronts cover the box face, `W` × `Hb`, divided by the front tree. Each
//! front is its opening less `G`: half on each side, so neighbors are `G`
//! apart. A pair of doors splits its opening in two first. Fronts are
//! banded on all four edges; doors run their grain up, drawer and false
//! fronts across.
//!
//! A **five-piece** front (the standard's `fivePiece` rules; the
//! `frontFrames` and `frontPanels` materials, or the doors') is two stiles
//! `s` wide the full height of the front, two rails `r` wide between them
//! that reach `j` into each stile, and a panel in grooves `p` deep, `c`
//! smaller than its grooves so it can move. For a front `F` wide and `E`
//! high: rails are `F − 2s + 2j` long, the panel `E − 2r + 2p − c` by
//! `F − 2s + 2p − c`. Frames are not banded.
//!
//! A **drawer box** (from the standard's `drawers` rules, the `drawerBox`
//! and `drawerBottom` materials, `t` their thickness) is as deep as the
//! longest stocked slide `L` that fits in `D` less the rear clearance; as
//! high as its opening less the vertical clearance `v`; and as wide as the
//! inside less the slide clearance `c` on each side. The sides run the full
//! depth and hold the front and back; the bottom sits in grooves `b` deep:
//!
//! | Part | Length × width |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `…/drawer/box.side.left`, `.right` | `L` × `opening − v` |
//! | `…/drawer/box.front`, `.back` | `W − 2T − 2c − 2t` × `opening − v` |
//! | `…/drawer/box.bottom` | `W − 2T − 2c − 2t + 2b` × `L − 2t + 2b` |
//!
//! **Shelves** of an open section or behind doors (the `shelves` rules,
//! the `shelves` material, or the case's) span the inside: `W − 2T` less
//! the side clearance, by `D` less the front setback and the back
//! allowance, banded in front like the case.
//!
//! A **face frame** (the standard's `faceFrame` rules, the `faceFrame`
//! material, `F` its thickness) covers the box face, `W` × `Hb`, with
//! butt joints: two stiles `s` wide the full height, top and bottom rails
//! `rt` and `rb` wide between them, and for each split of the front a rail
//! (`r` wide) or a mullion (`m` wide) between its openings, as long as the
//! opening it divides. The frame is part of the depth and stands out past
//! each side of the case by the overhang `o`, so the case is `W − 2o` wide
//! and `D − F` deep, and its front edges are not banded. The top of the
//! bottom is flush with the top of the bottom rail: the bottom is raised
//! `rb − T`, which shortens a grooved back by as much. Every frameless
//! formula above holds with these widths and depth.
//!
//! The front tree divides the frame's opening, `W − 2s` × `Hb − rt − rb`,
//! less its rails and mullions; a fixed size in the tree is the size of an
//! opening. A partial overlay front is its opening plus the overlay amount
//! on each edge; an inset front is its opening less `G` on each edge. The
//! doors of a pair are `G` apart. Overlays must stay on the frame and
//! clear each other by `G` over a rail or mullion. A drawer box is as wide
//! as its frame opening less the slide clearances, rather than the inside
//! of the case.
//!
//! The cut size of a part is its finished size less the thickness of the
//! bands on its ends (length) and sides (width).
//!
//! # Machining
//!
//! Each part carries its [`Operation`]s in its own coordinates: `x` along
//! its length from the `x0` end, `y` across its width from the `y0` edge,
//! on face `A` (toward the inside of the cabinet) or `B`. Sides run `x` up
//! from their bottom end and `y` forward from their rear edge; bottoms,
//! tops and shelves run `x` left to right and `y` forward; doors run `x` up
//! and `y` from their left edge as seen from the front; drawer box parts
//! run `y` up from their bottom edge.
//!
//! - **Back groove** (the `back` rules' `setback` `e`): as wide as the
//!   back is thick, `b`, centered `e + b/2` from the rear edge, the full
//!   length of the sides, the bottom and any top.
//! - **Line boring** (the `systemHoles` rules): in both sides, for each
//!   opening with shelves, a front column `f` from the case's front edge
//!   and a rear one `r` in front of the back, on a grid every `p` from the
//!   top of the bottom, clear of the opening's ends by `c`. Shelves must
//!   stop short of the back.
//! - **Hinges** (the `hinges` rules and the hinge's `cupDiameter` and
//!   `cupDepth`): as many as the table gives for the door's height, the
//!   first and last `e` from its ends and the rest evenly between, their
//!   cups' edge `k` from the hinge edge, in the door or its hinge stile. A
//!   pair hinges on its outer edges; a single door on its `hingeSide`. In
//!   a frameless cabinet, two holes on the front column of the side, `p`
//!   apart around each cup, take the hinge's plate; face frame hinges screw
//!   to the frame.
//! - **Drawer bottom groove** (the `drawers` rules'
//!   `bottomGrooveSetback`): as wide as the bottom is thick, the full
//!   length of the box's sides, front and back.
//!
//! Without a rule that only places machining, the parts are still given
//! and the evaluator notes what it could not machine.
//!
//! Anything else, such as other product types, other face frame joinery
//! and overrides, makes the product an error rather than giving parts that
//! would be wrong.
