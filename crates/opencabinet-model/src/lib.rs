//! The data model shared by every OpenCabinet module (RFC-0001).
//!
//! This crate has no I/O: it defines values and the rules they obey.
//!
//! - Quantities: [`Length`] in integer nanometers (ADR-0009), [`Angle`] in
//!   integer microdegrees, and [`Id`], the stable identity of an authored
//!   entity.
//! - Authored data: the [`Project`] with its rooms and products, and the
//!   [`Library`] of snapshots it uses.
//! - [`validate`]: the checks that need no evaluator.
//!
//! Every object keeps the fields this version does not know in `unknown`,
//! and every open enumeration keeps values it does not know in `Other`, so
//! a file written by a newer minor version or a plugin survives a save
//! (RFC-0001, invariant 7). Struct fields are written in declaration order.
